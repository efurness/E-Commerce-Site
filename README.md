# QUESTIONS 

After setting up the database and tables in the schema file my challenges were with the adding of roles including managers. The server.js file contained all the questions and prompts so the code was extensive.  The seeds file went well once I had all the name strings in quotes, parenthesis and commas in the right place, very detailed work.  I had to use a separate port than 3001 because the connection notified that it was inaccesible.
