# DESCRIPTION 

This is a command line application for E-commerce to retreive data from the database and using routes to generate the data in Insomnia using APIs.  Express.js runs the application and uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.  Models were created for the database part of the application.  The NPM run command got the seed data to be served to NODE.  Under the config folder, the connection.js ran the connection which had to be started to run the application.  Routes were tested in Insomnia.  

# INSTALLATION 

NODE JS, Express.JS, mySQL, NPM install to retrieve the packages including DotEnv and Sequelize.  API Routes POST, GET, PUT and DELETE were used.

# USAGE 

General usage for building an E-Commerce-Site.
 
# LICENSE 

Open source license

# CONTRIBUTING 

Solo Project, Contributors welcome

# TESTS 

Tests were run to establish all the various sql queries to display in Insomnia.
 
# QUESTIONS 

My questions included to create folder with the routes for products, categories and tags in Insomnia, but I was able to create folders and requests for each to display the routes.  The delete option I had to walk through it rather then just showing after deletion that the product or category was deleted.
